# Human Action Recognition (HAR) Project

This project demonstrates the implementation of an image recognition system using deep learning techniques, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The primary objective is to accurately classify images into predefined categories.

## Project Overview

The project encompasses the following key components:

- **Data Preparation**: Organizing and preprocessing the image dataset to ensure it is suitable for training the CNN model.

- **Model Development**: Constructing a CNN architecture tailored for image classification tasks using pre-trained models.

- **Training**: Training the CNN model using the prepared dataset to learn distinguishing features of different image classes.

- **Evaluation**: Assessing the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, loss, and generating a confusion matrix.

- **Visualization**: Visualizing the training process and results through graphs and plots to gain insights into the model's learning behavior.

## Prerequisites

Ensure that the following dependencies are installed:

- Python 3.11.7

- TensorFlow

- Keras

- NumPy

- Matplotlib

- scikit-learn

You can install these dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
```

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/udit710/Image-Recognition.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:

   ```bash
   cd Image-Recognition
   ```

3. **Open the Jupyter Notebook**:

   Launch Jupyter Notebook and open `model.ipynb`.

4. **Run the Notebook**:

   Execute the cells in the notebook sequentially to:

   - Load and preprocess the image dataset.

   - Build and train the CNN model.

   - Evaluate the model's performance.

   - Visualize the results.

## Results and Visualizations

The notebook includes visualizations of the training process, accuracy, loss, and a confusion matrix to assess the model's performance. These visualizations provide insights into the model's learning behavior and its effectiveness in classifying images.
